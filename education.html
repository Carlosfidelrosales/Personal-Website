            This is where it all started. I spent my elementary in this wonderful school. I met a lot of friends, play and socialize with them. In this school, you can also meet the best teacher and you can learn a lot from them.

            It was a new challenge for me to go in this school because it is very far from our house. So I experienced riding in a jeepney alone and I stepped out on my comfort zone. My life here had almost all of my favorite experiences and I was so happy to find a good circle of friends and bond with them.

            As of now, I'm taking my dream course Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I am now at my 2nd year and new challenges will be faced on. I choose this course because ever since I was a child I am into computers. My curiosity and love on PCs made me choose this degree. Someday I want to be successful to help my parents financially.
